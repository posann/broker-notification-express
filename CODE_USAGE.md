# **Code Usage Policy**

We believe in a transparent and respectful hiring process. The following policy is our commitment to you, ensuring your time and effort are valued.

## 1. For Evaluation Purposes Only

Your submission will be used solely to evaluate your skills and qualifications for the role you've applied for. It will not be integrated into our company's codebase, nor will it be used in any production or commercial capacity.

## 2. Intellectual Property Rights

The intellectual property of the code you write for this take-home assignment remains entirely with you. You are free to share it in a personal portfolio, on a GitHub account, or elsewhere, as long as it adheres to any other confidentiality agreements you may have.

## 3. Strict Confidentiality

Your code will be reviewed by a limited number of individuals directly involved in the hiring process. It will not be shared with external parties.

## 4. No Uncompensated Work

We are committed to not using this assignment as a means of obtaining free work. We have designed this test to be a fair, time-boxed challenge that reflects our standards, not a project intended for our own benefit.

## 5. Data Retention for Talent Pooling

We may securely retain all of your submission for future job vacancies to assess your fit for other roles that may arise. This is part of our talent pooling initiative. We will only contact you about relevant opportunities. If you would like your data to be deleted at any time, please contact us.
